# Cse366_Ucs_vs_A-
This is my first repository task

This repository contains the implementation of Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A Search (A)** algorithms for pathfinding in a grid environment. The simulation is built using Python and Pygame and provides a comparative analysis of the two algorithms in navigating through a grid environment with tasks and barriers.

 # Introduction 
This lab explores autonomous navigation using an agent-based model in a grid environment. The agent completes tasks while avoiding barriers, implementing Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A Search (A)** to demonstrate key concepts in optimal pathfinding and heuristic-driven navigation.


# Setup

 1. Requirements
 2.Python 3.13.0 or later
 3.Pygame library
